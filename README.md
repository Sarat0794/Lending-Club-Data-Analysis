# Lending-Club-Data-Analysis
-I have used Lending Club Dataset from Kaggle in this DataBricks notebook.

-Lending Club: Lending club is a peer to peer lending company. They provide personal loans, small business loans and auto-refinancing. There are a set of borrowers with bad credit history and no money, who want to borrow money. There is another set of investers who view the borrower profile and invest in them if they feel comfortable with the risk. Here the interest rates are typically higher than the regular bank.

-I have taken only one quater of data (Quater 4). -This notebook is mainly focused on Data Cleaning and Analysis.
-This notebook is written in PySpark and SQL.
